This is my code submitted for a series of "secret" Google algorithm challenges which funnel into their recruiting channel and resulted in an interview.

Note I have *not* included the problem statements (as amusing as they were) to not give away too much to those who havenâ€™t seen them yet!  This foobar thing is supposed to be secret after all.
