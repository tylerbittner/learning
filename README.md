# My Journey to Machine Learning Engineering

## About
This repository is to track knowlege I've gained and share projects/courses I've taken through my journey to upgrade my engineering skills and master machine learning & data science.  It includes links to my Juypter Notebooks for course work, code from tutorials & workshops, book notes, and lots of algorithm coding exercises.

Brief history: I did full stack software engineering for over 13 years using Perl, Java, Javascript, and C#, then at the senior level shifted focus into team leadership and project management for several years, then decided to shift back to what I love the most: building great software.  At that point Python became my clear language of choice and the journey into machine learning and data science began!
