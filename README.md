# Machine Learning Portfolio

## About
This is my portfolio to track knowlege I've gained and share the work I've done through projects and courses I've taken in my journey to upgrade my engineering skills and master machine learning.  It includes links to my Juypter Notebooks, code from tutorials & workshops, book notes, and lots of algorithm coding exercises.

Brief history: I did full stack software engineering for over 13 years using Perl, Java, Javascript, and C#, then at the senior level shifted focus into team leadership and project management for several years, then decided to shift back to what I love the most: building great software.  At that point Python became my clear language of choice and the journey into machine learning and data science began!
